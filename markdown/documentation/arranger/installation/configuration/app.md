title: Integrating Your App
---

Once Elasticsearch and Arranger are properly configured, you can integrate Arranger with your UI application.

Arrangers browser-side package, Arranger Components, is what provides the pre-configured UI components. These components are built using <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React</a>, so we highly recommend developing your UI application in React for the best integration experience.

<Note title="The DMS-UI">
As mentioned earlier, we also provide a pre-built React UI called DMS-UI, which facilitates the integration of Ego and Arranger in a web browser. You can find more information in our [DMS-UI documentation](https://overture.bio/documentation/dms-ui).
