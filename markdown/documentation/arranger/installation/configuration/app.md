title: Integrating Your App
---

Once Elasticsearch and Arranger are properly configured, you can integrate Arranger with your UI application.

Arrangers browser-side package, Arranger Components, is what provides the pre-configured UI components. These components are built using [React](https://reactjs.org/), so we highly recommend developing your UI application in React for the best integration experience.

<Note title="The DMS-UI">
As mentioned earlier, we also provide a pre-built React UI called DMS-UI, which facilitates the integration of Ego and Arranger in a web browser. You can find more information in our [DMS-UI documentation](https://overture.bio/documentation/dmsui).

If you want to see Arranger components implemented within a live enviorment checkout out [the CanCOGen VirusSeq Data Portal](https://virusseq-dataportal.ca/explorer).
