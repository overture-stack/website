title: Setup a Domain Name (Server Mode Only)
---

When deploying in server mode, it's crucial to obtain and configure a domain name. This allows the DMS services to be accessible externally.

Deploying in server mode primarily ensures that the DMS system is easily accessible to external users through a custom domain, all while being secured over HTTPS.

You'll need to specify this domain name during two key processes:

1. The SSL certificate installation.
2. Input into the DMS interactive configuration questionnaire.

If you belong to an institution or organization, it's recommended to liaise with your IT department for domain setup. On the other hand, if you're an independent user without the backing of an organizational IT structure, you can acquire a domain name through numerous reputable online providers.
