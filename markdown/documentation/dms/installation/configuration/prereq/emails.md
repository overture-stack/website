title: Make User E-mails Publicly Accessible
---

When a user logs in via their identity provider Ego captures, stores, and displays a contact e-mail. However, some providers may allow their users to make their email addresses private and not publicly accessible to an external service.

Private emails will not be able to login via Ego. To prevent this the user can change their privacy setting to allow access to their e-mail via that provider or login with a different provider that does not have this requirement or setting.

<Warning> **Note: ORCiD** is the only provider that currently has this capability where the user's email can be set to private.</Warning>

Some users will want to retain their privacy and not share their e-mail publicly.  As such, the Overture roadmap for Ego has a future enhancement to make this requirement configurable. However, for the current release, the two workarounds above must be used.
