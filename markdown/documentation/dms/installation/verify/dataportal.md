# Check Data Portal is Running

Access the data portal:
- **Local:** http://localhost:`<port>`/ 
- **Server** https://`<myDomain>`/

Your browser should now display the DMS data portal.

Once all post-deployment checks are completed, and any necessary configurations are done, your DMS platform is fully operational. Please refer to our [User Guides](../user-guides) for detailed user instructions.
