2. [Setting up and linking Song to an OAuth service](/documentation/score/installation-guide/configuration/authentication)
3. [Connecting Kafka](/documentation/song/installation/configurations/profiles/#kafka-profile-optional)
4. [Configuring ID management](/documentation/score/installation-guide/configuration/authentication)
