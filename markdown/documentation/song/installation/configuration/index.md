The following pages will cover several required components that need to be configured for the Song server. These components include:

- [Run Profiles](/documentation/song/installation/configuration/profiles)
- [Score Server Integration](/documentation/song/installation/configuration/score)
- [ID Management](/documentation/song/installation/configuration/id)
- [Schema Strictness](/documentation/song/installation/configuration/schema)

In addition to the required components, you may also be interested in configuring Song with [Event Management Integration](/documentation/song/installation/configuration/kafka).

All configuration values are located in the same `application.yml` file, which can be found at `song-server-[version]/conf/application.yml`.
