1. [Connecting Song with it's companion file transfer service (Score)](/documentation/song/installation/configuration/score/)
2. [Setting up and linking Song to an OAuth service](/documentation/song/installation/configuration/oauth)
3. [Connecting Kafka](/documentation/song/installation/configuration/kafka)
4. [Configuring ID management](/documentation/song/installation/configuration/id)
