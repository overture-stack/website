Need more info from Dusan re: `i would have explained though that you would separate for security reasons and also application-run_profile .properties/yml has meaning`

The server can easily be configured by creating the file `./conf/application-secure.properties`.  An example file is provide below that you can use as a template to generate this file, with each of the relevant configuration described in the following documentation sections. 


```bash
# Need this template from developers 
# The file provide din old doucmentaiotn is wrong - need template here
# examples of all configs in one file!
```
