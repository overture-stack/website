To successfully configure Score, there are three primary steps:

1. [Integrate Score with a Song Server](/documentation/score/installation/configuration/song) 
2. [Integrate Score with your Object Storage provider](/documentation/score/installation/configuration/object-storage)
3. [Integrate Score with an authentication and authorization service](/documentation/score/installation/configuration/authentication)

For more details on additional configuration options, refer to:

1. [Run Profiles](/documentation/score/installation/configuration/profiles)
2. [Other Bootstrap Properties (HashiCorp's Vault)](/documentation/score/installation/configuration/bootstrap)

All configurations are managed within a single environment variable file, referred to as `.env.score`.
