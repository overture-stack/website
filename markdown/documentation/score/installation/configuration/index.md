title: Configuring Score
---

There are several <span style="color:red"> required</span> components to configure for the Score server.  These include:

- [Run Profiles](/documentation/score/installation/configuration/profiles) 
- [Song Server Integration](/documentation/score/installation/configuration/song) 
- [Object Storage Integration](/documentation/score/installation/configuration/object-storage)
- [Other Bootstrap Properties](/documentation/score/installation/configuration/bootstrap)

All of these configurations are managed within the same file, `score-server-[version]/conf/application.properties`.
