# Managing Users

A user is any individual registered in Ego who needs to authorize themselves with Ego-aware applications.

<Note title="User Creation">
Users are created automatically in Ego after they successfully log into an Ego-aware application (including the Ego Admin UI itself) via a supported OAUTH identity provider. There is **NO** ability to manually create users through the admin UI or the API. This ensures that user creation only occurs by successfully authenticating with a supported identity provider.
</Note>

## Editing a User

To edit an existing user:

1. Click **Users** from the lefthand menu, then click the user you want to edit from the user table.
2. The user's details pane is displayed on the right. Click **Edit** and modify the fields as required:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| ID | Unique ID representing the user internally in Ego. Auto-generated by Ego and cannot be modified (read-only). |
| Name | Two input boxes to modify the user's first and last names. By default, these values are initially populated with the names as received from the identity provider during the first login. However, after the first login, the administrator is free to update these as required, the values are not synchronized with the identity provider afterwards. |
| Email | User's contact email. Auto-populated based on the email received from the identity provider during the first login. This value cannot be modified (read-only) and is not synchronized with the identity provider after the first login. |
| User Type | Select one of `ADMIN` or `USER`. If set to `ADMIN`, then this user can perform administrative functions via the Ego Admin UI and the API. |
| Status | Status of the user, determines if it is enabled for use or not.  Value can be `DISABLED`, `APPROVED`, `PENDING`, `REJECTED`.  To enable the user to have access to Ego-aware applications, select `APPROVED`. All other statuses will prevent the user from having access. |
| Created | Date & time when the user was first created.  Read-only, cannot be modified. |
| Last Login | Date & time when the user last logged in.  Read-only, cannot be modified. | 
| Language | Select the user's language preference. Note that this field is currently only cosmetic, it does not drive any language-aware behaviour in the applications. |  
| Groups | Use the `+ Add` button to add existing groups that you want this user to belong to. Once you add a group, the user will automatically inherit any permissions (but **NOT** applications) assigned to the group.  Alternatively, to remove a group, click `X` to the right of the group. |
| Applications | Use the `+ Add` button to add existing applications that this user has access to.  Alternatively, to remove an application, click `X` to the right of the application. |
| Permissions | List of policies (permission sets) assigned to this user and the specific `READ/WRITE/DENY` access granted for each policy. This list is read-only and cannot be modified. To assign a user to a policy, either edit the desired policy and add the user directly to it, or add the user to a group that already has that policy. |
| API Keys | Lists the user's API keys, if any. Only one API Key can have an `ACTIVE` status at a time. All historical `REVOKED` and `EXPIRED` keys will also be be displayed. If required, you can manually `REVOKE` an active key from this screen.  However, you cannot issue a new API Key (this can only be done via the API, see [here](/documentation/ego/user-guide/api#generating-an-api-key)). |

## Disabling a User

<Note title="No User Deletion in UI">
Users cannot be deleted via the Ego Admin UI. They can only be disabled. However, if it is absolutely necessary, users can be deleted via the API if the user has the correct administrative privileges. If you wish to delete users via the API, proceed with caution and be absolutely sure before performing the delete, as the user is not recoverable afterward.
</Note>

To disable a user:

1. Click **Users** from the lefthand menu, then click the user you want to edit from the user table.
2. The user's details pane is displayed on the right. Click **Disable**. You will be asked to confirm the operation.
3. Alternatively, you can also **Edit** the user, change the `Status` to `DISABLED`, then click **Save**.
