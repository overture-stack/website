title: Using the Admin UI
---

Ego's Admin UI streamlines the management of user and application authorization. Here we summarize relevant sections to check out within our Admin UI user guide:

- [Managing Applications](/documentation/ego/user-guide/admin-ui/applications): For step-by-step instructions to add, modify, or delete applications.

- [Managing Policies](/documentation/ego/user-guide/admin-ui/policies): Information and guidelines for creating, modifying, and removing policies.

- [Managing Groups](/documentation/ego/user-guide/admin-ui/groups): Information and guidelines for creating, modifying, and removing Groups.

- [Managing Users](/documentation/ego/user-guide/admin-ui/users): Add, edit, or remove users and ensure proper access control within your applications.

<Warning> **Note:** Although the Ego UI handles most tasks, direct API interactions might be necessary for certain user or application needs. For comprehensive instructions on API usage, please refer to our [Ego API user guide](/documentation/ego/user-guide/api).</Warning>
