title: Authentication
---

Only users granted the `ADMIN` role have the privilege to access the Ego UI and perform administrative tasks without directly interfacing with the API. 

If you're looking for a comprehensive guide on how to navigate and use the Ego UI, please refer to our [guide on using the Ego UI](/documentation/ego/user-guide/admin-ui).

While the Ego UI caters to most administrative tasks, there are instances where users or applications might prefer or need to interact directly with the API. This could be via a command line interface using cURL commands, through the Swagger UI, or for programmatic interactions by applications. Before leveraging these endpoints, it's essential to first authenticate with the Ego API.

For a detailed walkthrough on how users and applications can authenticate and interface with the Ego API, see our [guide on using the Ego API](/documentation/ego/user-guide/api).
