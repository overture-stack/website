title: Configuration
---

Now that Ego has been successfully installed and you have configured the first user and application, it's time to configure other settings in Ego. This may involve adding policies to govern application permissions, including groups and users who will utilize your application, or even registering new applications.

<Note title="tip">While the API REST endpoints can handle all Ego operations, we highly recommend administrators to use the Ego UI whenever possible. The Ego UI offers a user-friendly and centralized environment to manage your applications, policies, groups, and users.</Note>

Here we summarize relevant sections to check out within our user guide:

- [Managing Applications](/documentation/ego/user-guide/admin-ui/applications): For step-by-step instructions to add, modify, or delete applications.

- [Managing Policies](/documentation/ego/user-guide/admin-ui/policies): Information and guidelines for creating, modifying, and removing policies.

- [Managing Groups](/documentation/ego/user-guide/admin-ui/groups): Information and guidelines for creating, modifying, and removing Groups.

- [Managing Users](/documentation/ego/user-guide/admin-ui/users): Add, edit, or remove users and ensure proper access control within your applications.
