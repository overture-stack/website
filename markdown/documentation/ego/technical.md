# How Ego Works

Ego associates user or application identities with the permissions they have been granted, either directly or through a group. Permissions are encoded in time-sensitive authorization JWTs. The default expiry period of the JWT is configurable in Ego's setup.

Downstream services, such as a research data portal that needs to determine allowed actions for a user, make REST calls to Ego to verify the user and the authority represented by the supplied JWT. Ego can also accept a JWT and make decisions based on the encoded information to determine if a user or application can proceed.

The diagram below illustrates the relationship between the entities that work together to provide authorization and permission management in Ego:

## Glossary of Terms

| Term  | Description|
|-|-|
| User | Any individual registered in Ego that needs to be authorized for Ego-aware applications. |
| Application | A third party service that registers itself with Ego so that Ego can authorize users on its behalf. |
| Admin | Users authorized to register other users, groups, applications & policies through Egoâ€™s REST endpoints. |
| Group | A list of users with the same defined set of permissions. Admins can create new groups and add users to them. |
| Access Level | The degree of authority granted to a user or application (`READ/WRITE/DENY`). |
| Policy | A policy is a context for which an application may want to grant permissions to a particular user or group. |
| Scope | A scope defines the context (policy) and access level. |
| Application JWT |  A basic JWT token that encodes a `Client ID` and `Client Secret`, and authorizes an application to interact with Ego. |
| User JWT | A `Bearer` token that encodes the user's information. |
| User API Key | A random token generated to authorize a user for a specific scope, in the context of an application. Note that a user can have multiple active API keys, as long as they contain different scopes. |     

## Ego Tokens
 
User authentication tokens issued by Ego are signed <a href="http://jwt.io" target="_blank">JSON Web Tokens </a>(JWT). JWTs are an industry-standard method, as per <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc7519.txt" target="_blank">RFC 7519</a>, for securely representing claims between parties without the need for stateful storage. In Ego, JWTs are used as `Bearer` tokens and passed in the Authorization header of web requests. Authentication tokens establish the identity of an application or user and contain information about the request.

JWT data reflects the time of token issuance. Ego digitally signs the token with a publicly available signing key that applications must use to verify the authentication token. Most of Ego's REST endpoints require an Ego authentication token in the Authorization header to validate the identity before performing operations on data.

## Ego Application JWTs

Application JWTs contain information about an application's name, role (user/administrator), status, client credentials, and permissions (represented as scopes). You can identify an application token through the "application" block. Here's an example of an application token issued by Ego:

```json
{
  "iat": 1586974587,
  "exp": 1586985387,
  "sub": "593b93d4-30a0-4c0a-be9b-45d09d196a39",
  "iss": "ego",
  "jti": "1db416b6-4dee-4d1c-9c80-0798ad938694",
  "aud": [],
  "context": {
    "application": {
      "name": "Song",
      "clientId": "song",
      "redirectUri": "https://song-example-redirect.com",
      "errorRedirectUri": "https://song-example-redirect.com/404",
      "description": "This is an integration between Ego and Song.",
      "status": "APPROVED",
      "type": "ADMIN"
    },
    "groups": ["69b77768-2016-4f04-802e-37334d823fd1"],
    "scope": ["*.DENY"]
  }
}
```

## Ego User JWT

User JWTs contain information about the user's name, role (user/administrator), status, permissions (represented as scopes), and groups associated with their Ego account. You can identify a user token through the "user" block. Here's an example of a user token issued by Ego:

```json
{
 "iat": 1617732676,
 "exp": 1617743476,
 "sub": "25c24836-a924-4e47-b35d-5bec9690ff56",
 "iss": "ego",
 "jti": "016453d2-998e-4662-9b12-6baa208c34f8",
 "context": {
  "scope": [
   "SCORE.READ",
   "SONG.WRITE",
   "SONG.READ",
   "DMS.WRITE",
   "SCORE.WRITE",
   "DMS.READ"
  ],
  "user": {
   "email": "barry.allen@gmail.com",
   "status": "APPROVED",
   "firstName": "barry",
   "lastName": "allen",
   "createdAt": 1617152136269,
   "lastLogin": 1617732676272,
   "preferredLanguage": null,

   "providerSubjectId": "908761298318094571857",
   "type": "ADMIN",
   "groups": [
    "d1b669cc-fd52-46d7-937b-0ff8be76e3d2"
   ]
  }
 },
 "aud": [
  "dms"
 ]
}
```

## Ego assigned API Keys

An API Key is a unique secret password generated by Ego and associated with a specific user, their permissions, and a set of allowed applications.

For example, a user can configure a client program, such as <a href="/documentation/song" target="_blank">Song's command-line client</a>, with an API Key provided by Ego. The client program can then operate with the level of authority associated with the API Key.
